# Guess the Number
 I made a small game to guess the correct number.
 
 To run the game, do the following:
 
 1. Open Docker
 2. Make a new postgres db with default settings (if settings are different, change settings in db.js file of the server)
 3. Open your terminal in the server directory
 4. Run npm run start
 5. Open a second terminal in the client directory
 6. Run npm run start
 7. Now, both server should be running, client should be running, and database is ready to receive information
 8. You can start playing the game
